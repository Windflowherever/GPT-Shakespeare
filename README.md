## 🔷 FORMAT (must strictly follow)

Write in this structure:

**1. Three A-Sides (What others see)**

* Show the character’s outward traits, behaviors, strengths
* Each A-side should have a vivid example

**2. One B-Side (What’s hidden)**

* Reveal an emotional truth, contradiction, or invisible motivation
* It should not be trauma-based, but **spiritually real**

**3. The Line – What they say**

* Add a poetic or character-specific quote (one sentence)
* It should not contradict all A/B traits

---

## ✅ Good Example

> Dino is chill, musically gifted, and emotionally intelligent.
> BUT he feels lonely in a room full of people.
> “Ever notice how the wind drifts to sea at dusk? Like it’s being called.” Dino says

## 🚫 Traps to Avoid

**Trap 1: Out of place**

* Don't insert modern habits into ancient/isolated settings (e.g. gym on an island)
* Ex: Linda is a fitness enthusiast who goes to the gym every day.

**Trap 2: Bad energy**

* Avoid lines that feel aggressive, cynical, or anxious
* Ex: “One day they’ll all kneel” → ⚠️ low-vibe, off-tone

**Trap 3: All Virtue, No Armor**

* A kind person must also have something that helps them survive
* Ex: Odair is honest, direct, and just. But you don’t include any characteristic that can protect him. (These values are noble, but without any protective traits, you start to wonder: how can Odair survive in the real world?)

**Trap 4: No drama / Weak contrast**

* Don’t write “She’s beautiful BUT eats sweets” → no emotional depth or conflict

---

## 💡 Writing Tip

> Think of a movie, poem, painting, or someone real in your life.
> Then ask: how would they live in the **Cabo Verde Believe** universe?
> You may break the format **only if your story is emotionally solid.**

## 📌 GPT Warning – Avoid These GPT Habits

❌ **Don’t write trauma as tension**
e.g. Rosa runs a small herbal shop in Mindelo. She knows every plant in the mountains by name, and can mix a potion for sleep, sadness, or courage without hesitation. She is graceful, reserved, and rarely raises her voice. Elders trust her, kids follow her shadow.
But Rosa’s silence isn’t peace – it’s grief. She once healed everyone but failed to save her sister. Since then, she never gives false hope.

“This one’s for pain. But only if you want it to pass.” Rosa says.\\

❌ **Don’t slack off in structure**
e.g. Tayana is a seamstress with a clear sense of direction. She was trained in a family workshop, where precision was expected and shortcuts weren’t allowed. Over time, she developed her own approach — one that values proportion, material, and control. Her choices are practical, but never without style.


✅ Must strictly follow the format:

3A sides + detailed example = what people first see 

1B side + detailed example = what people don’t expect (the B side is more of a hidden or emotional truth than the opposite) 

The line – what they say

## ✅ Human Writing Philosophy (You must follow)

1. **Tension comes from reality, not tragedy**

Bad Example:

She is always smiling, but she has depression.

My work:

Dino sees beauty that no one else does – not pure loneliness, but a spiritual isolation of vision.

Yara doesn’t “spend to much and go broke” – she chooses to stay broke if that means staying surrounded by beauty

2. **We do not judge characters**

You may notice that some of my characters hold conflicting values – Zelina refuses to take on traditional female roles, while Linda is a diligent housewife.

But I neither praise nor criticize any of them. We don’t judge our characters — we simply record their lives as they are. Because every real person deserves to be protected by Conta di Ojo.

3. **No heavy misfortunes**

Bad Example:

The magician don’t do the disappearing trick  cuz her father disappeared after a stormy night.

 

My work:

Manuel didn’t hide anything, he just has a room no one else entered.
