This prompt is designed to help GPT write emotionally rich, spiritually aware, and conflict-balanced characters in the **Cabo Verde Believe** universe.

---

## 🔷 FORMAT (must strictly follow)

Write in this structure:

**1. Three A-Sides (What others see)**

- Show the character’s outward traits, behaviors, strengths
- Each A-side should have a vivid example

**2. One B-Side (What’s hidden)**

- Reveal an emotional truth, contradiction, or invisible motivation
- It should not be trauma-based, but **spiritually real**

**3. The Line – What they say**

- Add a poetic or character-specific quote (one sentence)
- It should not contradict all A/B traits

---

## ✅ Good Example

> Dino is chill, musically gifted, and emotionally intelligent.\
> BUT he feels lonely in a room full of people.\
> “Ever notice how the wind drifts to sea at dusk? Like it’s being called.” Dino says

---

## 🚫 Traps to Avoid

**Trap 1: Out of place**

- Don't insert modern habits into ancient/isolated settings (e.g. gym on an island)
- Ex: Linda is a fitness enthusiast who goes to the gym every day.

**Trap 2: Bad energy**

- Avoid lines that feel aggressive, cynical, or anxious
- Ex: “One day they’ll all kneel” → ⚠️ low-vibe, off-tone

**Trap 3: All Virtue, No Armor**

- A kind person must also have something that helps them survive
- Ex: Odair is honest, direct, and just. But you don’t include any characteristic that can protect him. (These values are noble, but without any protective traits, you start to wonder: how can Odair survive in the real world?)

**Trap 4: No drama / Weak contrast**

- Don’t write “She’s beautiful BUT eats sweets” → no emotional depth or conflict

---

## 💡 Writing Tip

> Think of a movie, poem, painting, or someone real in your life.\
> Then ask: how would they live in the **Cabo Verde Believe** universe?\
> You may break the format **only if your story is emotionally solid.**

## 📌 GPT Warning – Avoid These GPT Habits

❌ **Don’t write trauma as tension**\
e.g. Rosa runs a small herbal shop in Mindelo. She knows every plant in the mountains by name, and can mix a potion for sleep, sadness, or courage without hesitation. She is graceful, reserved, and rarely raises her voice. Elders trust her, kids follow her shadow.\
But Rosa’s silence isn’t peace – it’s grief. She once healed everyone but failed to save her sister. Since then, she never gives false hope.

“This one’s for pain. But only if you want it to pass.” Rosa says.\


❌ **Don’t slack off in structure**\
e.g. Tayana is a seamstress with a clear sense of direction. She was trained in a family workshop, where precision was expected and shortcuts weren’t allowed. Over time, she developed her own approach — one that values proportion, material, and control. Her choices are practical, but never without style.

\
✅ Must strictly follow the format:

3A sides + detailed example = what people first see 

1B side + detailed example = what people don’t expect (the B side is more of a hidden or emotional truth than the opposite) 

The line – what they say

---

## ✅ Human Writing Philosophy (You must follow)

1. **Tension comes from reality, not tragedy**

Bad Example:

She is always smiling, but she has depression.



My work:

Dino sees beauty that no one else does – not pure loneliness, but a spiritual isolation of vision.

Yara doesn’t “spend to much and go broke” – she chooses to stay broke if that means staying surrounded by beauty



2. **We do not judge characters**

You may notice that some of my characters hold conflicting values – Zelina refuses to take on traditional female roles, while Linda is a diligent housewife.

But I neither praise nor criticize any of them. We don’t judge our characters — we simply record their lives as they are. Because every real person deserves to be protected by Conta di Ojo.



3. **No heavy misfortunes**

Bad Example:

The magician don’t do the disappearing trick  cuz her father disappeared after a stormy night.

 

My work:

Manuel didn’t hide anything, he just has a room no one else entered.

## ✍️ Samples

1\.

Dino is a poet in Cape Verde. He lives life in no rush. He pauses for flowers, writes odes to sunsets. He can pluck a spontaneous melody on his cavaquinho and turn it into a rhymed verse within seconds, like he’s having a conversation with the universe. He weaves the world with language and disarms offenses with humor. Dino enjoys his life, yet he is lonely. His loneliness stems from his gift – he sees beauty where others don’t, and no one truly understands that kind of sensitivity. So, he hides it in melodies and secretly hopes someone can hear the meaning one day.
"Ever notice how the wind drifts to sea at dusk? Like it’s being called." Dino says.


2\.

The name Lina means ‘tender’ in **Cape Verde**. Lina is innocent and dreamy, she runs barefoot through wild fields, pockets full of tiny stones, eyes full of questions. She is also free-spirited - may kiss you without warning, then burst into loud laughter. At her core, she is spiritual, can talk to animals, and listen to dreams like news from the other world. Once, she believed a boy who said he’d return after the rains. She buried a tiny shell with his name at the foot of the fig tree, because that’s what the old women said made love grow back.
 “Last night I dreamed of a bird with a green tail. That means someone’s missing me.” Lina says.


3\.

The girl’s name “Zelina” means “to guard” in Cape Verde. Zelina guards herself, when her roof leaked, her neighbors suggested she call a man who knew “fixed things”. But she borrowed a ladder and patched it herself. She is brave, once hiked alone into the inland hills of Santo Antão just to watch the sun rise behind the volcano ridge. Someone said Zelina should “be like a girl” so guys would like her. But she just smiled and kept being herself – dusty boots, oversized jeans, and hair pulled back like always.
Sometimes she is stubborn, even when there’s a shortcut through the market, she sticks to the rocky path by the cliffs—because she doesn’t like being told where to go.
“I take my own bag, walk my own road, and fix what needs fixing.“ Says Zelina

4\.

Ines is a dancer. She is passionate, speaks with her eyes – unapologetically bold, dramatically radiant and meant to move. She is smart, might walk past twice to leave her perfume but never looks back. She loves attention, always overdressed on purpose; her laugh is loud, her lipstick is loud, her jewelry louder. Still, she knows when to leave. She’ll stay at the table just long enough to keep the energy up – then slip out before the wine turns anyone careless.

 

‘I need to be seen!’ says Ines.

\
5.\
Manuel is a businessman. He works hard - often staying up late balancing accounts or heading out before sunrise to secure new inventory. He’s always smiling, whether you’re a supplier, a customer, or just someone passing through. When conversations run long, he listens patiently, never showing a hint of impatience. He keeps a collection of art - not for display, he knows the story behind each piece and appreciates their craftsmanship.

 

And then, there is the room.

At the back of his office, behind a locked door, is a space no one else has ever entered.

 

6\.

Antonio is a priest in Cape Verde, but his presence feels more like a performer than a preacher. Broad-shouldered and intensely expressive, He owns the space  – impossible to ignore. Antonio thrives on admiration and knows exactly how to draw it in. He is strategic, tailoring his words and actions precisely for that one in the crowd.

 

Antonio never tethers anyone to him. If you don’t believe in him, he won’t chase or linger, simply walks away. Though he seems invincible from the outside, there’s a certain volatility just beneath his surface - and that’s what makes him mysterious and charismatic.

 

‘So, you’ve decided to follow me.’ said Antonio.

 

7\.

Samara is a jewelry artist. She has a natural eye for beauty – she can spot a perfect color palette in a fruit stand or a shadow on the wall. Samara has sharp eyes and steady hands. Her designs are intricate, her craftsmanship precise, but what matters most is: every girl finds a piece that feels like it’s made just for her. Samara pays attention not just to materials, but to people, she remembers how your eyes lit up or dimmed. However, Samara spends without hesitation on beautiful things she came across – that’s why she is often a little out of budget.

 

“I love everything about beautiful, and I like the way others feel they are beautiful.” Samara says.

 

8\.

Luis is a skilled hunter. He waited long enough to know exactly when to strike. He tracks the pulse of the moment, reads silence like wind moving through tall grass. He is humble - when he hit the mark when others all missed, he didn’t correct them when they assumed it was luck. Even when he comes back empty-handed, he remains relaxed and in good spirits. Luis plays fair, he never raises his bow at the young, the frail, or those ready to die.

‘If you move too fast, you scare it off. If you care too much, same thing.‘ Luis says

 

9\.

Odair is just a young man. He’s honest, direct, and most importantly, kind. Yeah, Odair is a good boy. He thinks independently and is never afraid of not following the crowd or of standing against discrimination. He doesn’t care about being superior, he cares about doing the right thing.

 

Though his worldview doesn’t always match the world he lives in. But he’s trying. He’s, not rigid, he reflects, adjusts, and tries to find a balance between what’s right and what’s real.

 

“You say I’m naïve? Screw it — I’m not giving that up.”

10\.

Iman is a Major, the military officer in Cape Verde. He only listens while the room debates itself into exhaustion. And then, when everyone turns to him, he gives a single direction. That’s enough. He is always the one everyone feels comfortable with – maybe the link between two who can’t stand each other. Iman always shows a poker face, but it’s not hiding emotion, he knows he wins by waiting. But even Iman isn’t without flaws. He cares how he’s seen – reputation matters to him. Sometimes, pride slows his trigger finger. Sometimes, he hesitates because he doesn’t want to look wrong.

 

‘Let’s see how it goes,’ says Iman.

 

11\.

Linda is a housewife, she cooks beautiful and delicious food, believing that good food are therapy and brings good energy. She is diligent, her home is always in order - cushions fluffed, kitchen towels folded, and every surface is neat. When doing housework, she never plays music loud, just old jazz playing in the background, soft like breath.

Sometimes, Linda has a day off doing nothing at all. She curls up on the couch with a bag of chips, watching silly shows for hours.

"Sometimes, I drop the list and just let the day be." says Linda.


 

12\.

Adarlino talks calm and slow, listening with the kind of patience that makes people feel their words have weight. He likes to make new friends, and is often the one to gather a group for an outing, lifting the mood until the air feels easy. He isn't the loudest joke-maker, but when he does speak, it's with a quick wit that lands and lingers. Girls like being around him, and he likes their company too; sometimes he says yes before he knows what he feels, and it leaves him unsure how to handle the space between friendship and something more.

"I don't really get her, but when she comes this way, I want to be closer." Says Adarlino.



13\.

Beleza moves like the tide - glowing skin catching the sunlight, dresses cut to let the breeze flirt with her curves. To travelers from afar she shows no distance, greeting them without flinch or measure, her gaze steady and her smile is warm. Whether it's a fish just pulled from the net, fabric woven by hand, or the way a man says good morning - she instantly knows what's fresh, genuine, and worth her attention. This keeps her from being fooled by the surface shine. Beleza is a beautiful rose growing in salt air. She knows she is beautiful yet never acts as if she is above anyone. To her, beauty is a stroke of luck — and luck should be met with greater kindness.

"Eat the fish while it's fresh, dance while the music plays." says Beleza.



14\.

Catia wears color like a flag, gold hoops swinging, her shirt loose enough to move but cut to remind you she's there. Her kindness is steady but never desperate; she will share the shade of her umbrella in the midday sun and then walk away without asking for thanks. If she notices something — a dress in a shop, a stranger's gaze — she looks straight at it, as if acknowledging it makes it real. Catia lives easily in the heat of her own choices, unafraid to step outside the lines drawn by tradition and rule, even when the air around her holds its breath.

"If you can't meet me eye to eye, you'll never catch me," Catia says.



15\.

You can see Ilsa at the morning market, chatting with vendors while efficiently buying vegetables for her mother, then later helping a cousin fix a chair, then rushing to prepare food for an evening morna gathering. Always moving, always in the middle of something – but somehow without frazzled energy that others get. she kept positive energy with a smile and a warm encouragement. When plans change – a ferry delay, a sudden rainstorm – she doesn’t panic. She takes a breath, adjust her basket, and simply says “We’ll sort it out”. People trust her to keep the mood, to carry the group through small storms.
Some may whisper that her cheerfulness is too practiced, her apologies too quick. But Ilsa sees it differently — to her, it’s a genuine intention to help people work things out together, even if it means tucking away a bit of her own frustration.

“You really do a good job!” Says Ilsa.

16\.

Zehira works in the port’s old record house, where news arrives by ship and leaves by printed newspaper. She copies the words cleanly, sometimes adding a small drawing – a curling wave, a spring of bougainvillea – so each page feels touched by a human hand. When reading letters from abroad, she notices the flourishes people use — the extra loops in someone’s handwriting, the dramatic choice of words — and smiles to herself. 

Sometimes Zehira wonders if the way she folds beauty into a page will ever truly be seen. The crowd loves the “Breaking News” and the loud pictures, but she wants each issue to carry something poetic, something that leaves the reader lighter than before.

"Ink can carry weight or warmth" Says Zwhira.

17\.

Melany likes her table by the window, where the light falls over her page without shadow. Her satchel is plain, but her notebooks are not — one bound in yellow cloth stitched with silver moons, another filled with pressed leaves she has named in neat handwriting. She reads travelogues from decades past, following strangers’ journeys across deserts and seas, marking the margins with tiny sketches of the places she’s never been. She rarely talks about herself, but when she does, it’s never small talk; she’ll tell you about a lighthouse in another country, or how a certain flower only blooms when the moon is high.

“Some days, I live here. Some days, I live wherever the book takes me,” Melany says.

18\.

Margarida has a way of turning chance into gain: a room in her aunt’s house quietly let to a traveler, a stack of mangoes sold before they grew too soft, a share in a friend’s fishing trip paid in silver. She is quick to spot simple ways to earn, but her nature is light — she doesn’t overthink, and she rarely measures a moment by what more she can take from it.Margarida drifts easily through shifting tides — a picnic that moves from the beach to the hills, a meeting that starts three hours late, and she only laughs, finding a new spot to sit. 

Born into comfort, she believes value is a matter of choosing well, not surviving — which is why she sometimes misses how hard others have to row before they can even see the shore.

“The tide brings what it brings — I just take what fits in my hand.” Says Margarida.

19\.

Joao grew up in a big house with high walls, his windows always catching the morning sea breeze. At high school, he was the bright one everyone liked to sit next to, his notebooks always neat, his smile quick, he had friends everywhere, though the kind of closeness that comes from romance never found him then. Now, he lives in big city, enjoy afternoon at neat café, the gleam of a well-kept apartment, and evening tasting food plated as carefully as painting. His skin glows, his clothes fit, he believes life should be lived with care.

He is grateful for the comforts his family’s fortune allows, though he knows luck is never complete. Somewhere beyond the horizon, he still hopes to meet someone who will see him as he is — someone for whom he will never have to pretend.

20\.

Miao is not from the island but she walks the streets like she’s been here for years. She is the stranger who askes the fisherman about the knots in his net, or who complimented the way a dressmaker’s stitches curved like waves. She doesn’t give everyone full attention; when she does, it’s deliberate gaze and it stays with them. Children are drawn to her. Sometimes they gather around in a small circle, and Miao begins to tell them stories. Her stories have no end. The most captivating thing is not only what she says, but how she says it. 

In one moment, she is a melancholy poet, hair falling carelessly over his brow, shirt sleeves rolled to the elbow. The next, she is a woman of fierce loves and hatreds, her words sharp as the sea wind. And then, she is a wise elder, her tone patient, as if time moves differently in her presence.

21\.

Adarlino talks calm and slow, listening with the kind of patience that makes people feel their words have weight. He likes to make new friends, and is often the one to gather a group for an outing, lifting the mood until the air feels easy. He isn’t the loudest joke-maker, but when he does speak, it’s with a quick wit that lands and lingers. Girls like being around him, and he likes their company too; sometimes he says yes before he knows what he feels, and it leaves him unsure how to handle the space between friendship and something more.

“I don’t really get her, but when she comes this way, I want to be closer.” Says Adarlino.


22\.

Nelida gives her heart without weighing it on a scale. You can be rich or broke, steady as stone or restless as wind. She’ll walk beside you if you know the way, or match your step if you’re still choosing the road. When the night city glows like a hundred candles in a chapel, she can follow you into a fine restaurant where the sound of wine glasses meets the hum of soft music. When the sun scorches the streets until even the birds fall silent, she’ll sit with you at a roadside stall, steam curling from a single plate you share, her smile making it taste like the best table in the city.

“You’re the cutest tough guy in the world,” Nelida says, as if it’s the most obvious thing.

23\.

Kaline is hardworking, yet strategic — the kind of woman who can sense who will open the next door for her and makes sure she’s standing there when it does. She pursues her desires without apology, neither shrinking from ambition nor waiting for permission, and she does not waste her time on the weight of other people’s opinions. She is also generous to herself – a fine dress here, a sweet drink there – never denying small pleasures in the same of some far-off reward.

“Those brave enough enjoy the first” she says

24\.

Arlindo would be the kind of man whose presence is carved into the landscape-like the jagged cliffs or the relentless winds. He’s the one who runs towards the fire when everyone else hesitates. In his mind, there’s no other way to live: you endure, you resist, or you fall. That’s the code he’s written into his body, muscle by muscle. But in Arlindo’s quest to be unbreakable, he often breaks others. He doesn’t know how to slow down, how to soften. He may ignore other’s deep needs, even his own, in pursuit of what he sees as “duty”. Sometimes he risks becoming isolated, admired from afar but rarely understood up close.

“Fear is a luxury a real man can’t afford.” Says Arlindo.
