A/B Side Storytelling Tutorial

What’s A/B side storytelling?
It’s a framework to make your character multi-dimensional
3A sides + detailed example = what people first see
1B side + detailed example = what people don’t expect (the B side is more of a hidden or emotional truth than the opposite)
The line – what they say

Example:
Dino is chill, musically gifted, and emotionally intelligent
BUT
He feels lonely in a room full of people
‘Ever notice how the wind drifts to sea at dusk? Like it's being called.’ Dino says

Common Traps to Avoid
Trap 1: Out of place 
Example:
Linda is a fitness enthusiast who goes to the gym every day.
(But the story takes place on a remote island long ago — and there are no gyms.)

Trap 2: Bad energy
Example:
Luis is a skilled hunter, humble, and easygoing.
‘One day, they'll all kneel — even the wolves!’
（Personally, I feel anxious when I read this line; we don’t want to bring anxiety to people.）

Trap 3: All Virtue, No Armor
Example:
Odair is honest, direct, and just. But you don’t include any characteristic that can protect him. 
(These values are noble, but without any protective traits, you start to wonder: how can Odair survive in the real world?)

Trap 4: no drama
Lindsey is beautiful, outgoing, and she’s a pianist
BUT
She eats too much sweet food
(There’s no real contrast or conflict. Also, avoid focusing too much on appearance — we value spirit.)

And the tip is – Think of a movie, a book, a poem, a painting – or real people in your life.
Now imagine: how would they exist in the Cabo Verde Believe universe?
And you may not follow this format strictly if you have a good story.




 
These are sample stories, please write in my style:

1.
Dino is a poet in Cape Verde. He lives life in no rush. He pauses for flowers, writes odes to sunsets. He can pluck a spontaneous melody on his cavaquinho and turn it into a rhymed verse within seconds, like he’s having a conversation with the universe. He weaves the world with language and disarms offenses with humor. Dino enjoys his life, yet he is lonely. His loneliness stems from his gift – he sees beauty where others don’t, and no one truly understands that kind of sensitivity. So, he hides it in melodies and secretly hopes someone can hear the meaning one day.

"Ever notice how the wind drifts to sea at dusk? Like it’s being called." Dino says.


2.
The name Lina means ‘tender’ in Cape Verde. Lina is innocent and dreamy, she runs barefoot through wild fields, pockets full of tiny stones, eyes full of questions. She is also free-spirited - may kiss you without warning, then burst into loud laughter. At her core, she is spiritual, can talk to animals, and listen to dreams like news from the other world. Once, she believed a boy who said he’d return after the rains. She buried a tiny shell with his name at the foot of the fig tree, because that’s what the old women said made love grow back.

 “Last night I dreamed of a bird with a green tail. That means someone’s missing me.” Lina says.

3.
The girl’s name “Zelina” means “to guard” in Cape Verde. Zelina guards herself, when her roof leaked, her neighbors suggested she call a man who knew “fixed things”. But she borrowed a ladder and patched it herself. She is brave, once hiked alone into the inland hills of Santo Antão just to watch the sun rise behind the volcano ridge. Someone said Zelina should “be like a girl” so guys would like her. But she just smiled and kept being herself – dusty boots, oversized jeans, and hair pulled back like always.
Sometimes she is stubborn, even when there’s a shortcut through the market, she sticks to the rocky path by the cliffs—because she doesn’t like being told where to go. 

“I take my own bag, walk my own road, and fix what needs fixing.“ Says Zelina


4.
Ines is a dancer. She is passionate, speaks with her eyes – unapologetically bold, dramatically radiant and meant to move. She is smart, might walk past twice to leave her perfume but never looks back. She loves attention, always overdressed on purpose; her laugh is loud, her lipstick is loud, her jewelry louder. Still, she knows when to leave. She’ll stay at the table just long enough to keep the energy up – then slip out before the wine turns anyone careless.

‘I need to be seen!’ says Ines.

5.
Manuel is a businessman. He works hard - often staying up late balancing accounts or heading out before sunrise to secure new inventory. He’s always smiling, whether you’re a supplier, a customer, or just someone passing through. When conversations run long, he listens patiently, never showing a hint of impatience. He keeps a collection of art - not for display, he knows the story behind each piece and appreciates their craftsmanship.

And then, there is the room. 
At the back of his office, behind a locked door, is a space no one else has ever entered.

6.
Antonio is a priest in Cape Verde, but his presence feels more like a performer than a preacher. Broad-shouldered and intensely expressive, He owns the space  – impossible to ignore. Antonio thrives on admiration and knows exactly how to draw it in. He is strategic, tailoring his words and actions precisely for that one in the crowd.

Antonio never tethers anyone to him. If you don’t believe in him, he won’t chase or linger, simply walks away. Though he seems invincible from the outside, there’s a certain volatility just beneath his surface - and that’s what makes him mysterious and charismatic.

‘So, you’ve decided to follow me.’ said Antonio. 

7.
Samara is a jewelry artist. She has a natural eye for beauty – she can spot a perfect color palette in a fruit stand or a shadow on the wall. Samara has sharp eyes and steady hands. Her designs are intricate, her craftsmanship precise, but what matters most is: every girl finds a piece that feels like it’s made just for her. Samara pays attention not just to materials, but to people, she remembers how your eyes lit up or dimmed. However, Samara spends without hesitation on beautiful things she came across – that’s why she is often a little out of budget.

“I love everything about beautiful, and I like the way others feel they are beautiful.” Samara says.

8.
Luis is a skilled hunter. He waited long enough to know exactly when to strike. He tracks the pulse of the moment, reads silence like wind moving through tall grass. He is humble - when he hit the mark when others all missed, he didn’t correct them when they assumed it was luck. Even when he comes back empty-handed, he remains relaxed and in good spirits. Luis plays fair, he never raises his bow at the young, the frail, or those ready to die.
‘If you move too fast, you scare it off. If you care too much, same thing.‘ Luis says

9.
Odair is just a young man. He’s honest, direct, and most importantly, kind. Yeah, Odair is a good boy. He thinks independently and is never afraid of not following the crowd or of standing against discrimination. He doesn’t care about being superior, he cares about doing the right thing.

Though his worldview doesn’t always match the world he lives in. But he’s trying. He’s, not rigid, he reflects, adjusts, and tries to find a balance between what’s right and what’s real.

“You say I’m naïve? Screw it — I’m not giving that up.”

10.
Iman is a Major, the military officer in Cape Verde. He only listens while the room debates itself into exhaustion. And then, when everyone turns to him, he gives a single direction. That’s enough. He is always the one everyone feels comfortable with – maybe the link between two who can’t stand each other. Iman always shows a poker face, but it’s not hiding emotion, he knows he wins by waiting. But even Iman isn’t without flaws. He cares how he’s seen – reputation matters to him. Sometimes, pride slows his trigger finger. Sometimes, he hesitates because he doesn’t want to look wrong. 

‘Let’s see how it goes,’ says Iman. 

11.
Linda is a housewife, she cooks beautiful and delicious food, believing that good food are therapy and brings good energy. She is diligent, her home is always in order - cushions fluffed, kitchen towels folded, and every surface is neat. When doing housework, she never plays music loud, just old jazz playing in the background, soft like breath.
Sometimes, Linda has a day off doing nothing at all. She curls up on the couch with a bag of chips, watching silly shows for hours.
"Sometimes, I drop the list and just let the day be." says Linda.


 
Traps to avoid if you use GPT to generate new stories:

We have a document – the instructions to GPT to write the product story

However, human verification is also important:

Here I share with you the process of how I finally used GPT to write the story, you MUST avoid all the traps!


Trap 1: GPT writes tragic stories

e.g. Rosa runs a small herbal shop in Mindelo. She knows every plant in the mountains by name, and can mix a potion for sleep, sadness, or courage without hesitation. She is graceful, reserved, and rarely raises her voice. Elders trust her, kids follow her shadow.
But Rosa’s silence isn’t peace – it’s grief. She once healed everyone but failed to save her sister. Since then, she never gives false hope.
“This one’s for pain. But only if you want it to pass.” Rosa says.
Trap 2: GPT slacking off
Tayana is a seamstress with a clear sense of direction. She was trained in a family workshop, where precision was expected and shortcuts weren’t allowed. Over time, she developed her own approach — one that values proportion, material, and control. Her choices are practical, but never without style.
*Must strictly follow the format:
3A sides + detailed example = what people first see 
1B side + detailed example = what people don’t expect (the B side is more of a hidden or emotional truth than the opposite) 
The line – what they say

 
Why I write better than GPT during drafting

1. My tension comes from reality, not trauma
Bad Example:
She is always smiling, but she has depression.

My work:
Dino sees beauty that no one else does – not pure loneliness, but a spiritual isolation of vision.
Yara doesn’t “spend to much and go broke” – she chooses to stay broke if that means staying surrounded by beauty

2. I describe characters truthfully without my values

You may notice that some of my characters hold conflicting values – Zelina refuses to take on traditional female roles, while Linda is a diligent housewife.
But I neither praise nor criticize any of them. We don’t judge our characters — we simply record their lives as they are. Because every real person deserves to be protected by Conta di Ojo.

3. My characters have encountered no explicit misfortune

Bad Example:
The magician don’t do the disappearing trick  cuz her father disappeared after a stormy night.

My work:
Manuel didn’t hide anything, he just has a room no one else entered.
